Space Invaders
The classic Space Invaders was the first blockbuster arcade video game, responsible for starting the golden age of video arcade games. It also sets the template for the shoot 'em up genre, and influences nearly every shooter game released since then.

The classic Space Invaders 1978 was created by Tomohiro Nishikado and was released by Taito Corporation in the year 1978.

Concept
In my Implementation of the game, the concept remains the same, i.e the player spaceship shoots the aliens or monsters and in doing so gain points followed by level ups and increase in game speed and difficulty.

What differs from the classic implementation and the features are are listed below:

In each level, the number of enemies equals the level number, unlike the classic version in which there are 55 enemies each level.
After a certain number of kills, the difficulty goes up, resulting in a speed increase of the aliens.
The enemy keeps on respawning and will never die completely.
The enemy may shoot a laser beam depending on random chance or probability.
The random chance or probability of the enemy shooting you goes up as level increases.
The score is incremented on a successful kill and the value is based on the level number and difficulty number.

The features of the game is as follows:

The player can be moved left or right using the Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys.
The game can be paused (v1.1.2 onwards) with Enter key or Esc key.

The game has a background music (the classic Space Invaders music) which changes and becomes more intense with increase in difficulty.
